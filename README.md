# Hangman

## The Function of This Program
The function of this project called "Hangman" is a to work as a word game where the user has to guess the word presented on the screen. This is done by pressing keys on the keyboard. The user is given a specific amount of guesses based on the amount of letters in the unknown word. If the user produces a correct guess, an image of the artist will show up and a 15 second snippet of one of their songs will play. If the user fails to guess the word, a new word is chosen and a win is not accounted. The theme of the website is current Hip-Hop artists, whihc gives a hint for the user. All of the functions performed on the website are created using **Javascript**. The layout was created using **Bootstrap**.

Various variables and arrays are used for the game. The altering and comparing of arrays are what the game primarily relies on. This can be seen with the "unknown" and "blanks" arrays. A function was created to run certain parts of the game such as setting up a new game. I previously created other functions but the program would not run so I settled on not defining the functions. Lastly, all the actionsa are performed using If Else comparisons and reading user key entries. Using javascript, the source of the audio and image changes based on the answer. The text on the screen is also altered based on the current status of the game.



## The Usefulness
Using this website and analyzing this code can help give an understanding on how to use Javascript to perform website functions. Functions such as "push", "join", and "getElementByID" are utilized to perform the primary functions of the website's game.
